# Compatibility and verification

Native JavaScript/Express implementation; immutable public Rails reference `659f957`.
Existing SQLite schema, original files, bcrypt credentials and Rails JSON cookies are
the compatibility contract. Raw evidence stays ignored in `tmp/`.

| Area | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Rails signing, encryption and CSRF | Independent Rails vectors verify PBKDF2 keys, signed/encrypted cookies, signed IDs including large integers, SGIDs, application verifiers, Turbo streams, session continuity, purpose/expiry/signature rejection and 189 CSRF cases. Bounded data-only Marshal fixtures come from Ruby. |
| SQLite and messages | Real isolated databases test nested rollback, membership authorization, raw timestamp cursors, persisted writes, updates/deletion and FTS; independent HTTP checks compare actual stored records. |
| Frontend | Independent browser checks cover live compose/edit/delete/boost, mentions, paging, search, private/direct rooms, image upload/lightbox, administration and fresh setup. |
| Sessions | Independent original Rails server accepts Express-issued cookies and Express accepts Rails-issued cookies on shared disposable data. |
| Action Cable | Real sockets verify native subscription delivery, forged stream rejection, membership revocation, logout revocation and multi-tab presence. Cross-worker production browser delivery is exercised. |
| Storage and media | Actual 3840×2160 JPEG becomes 1200×675; real ffmpeg audio/video analysis and poppler PDF preview; Rails-issued signed transform accepted; direct upload checksum/range/owner/private-room checks and failed-media rollback. |
| Benchmarks | Matched production images with identical ordered 40-room/40-page/13-search windows, zero timed request failures, every acknowledged write stored with rich text and FTS, and SQLite integrity checks. Two paced runs admit all 100 sockets and deliver all 30 messages to every connection. Raw output remains ignored. |
| Jobs and bots | Actual queued HTTP delivery and persisted bot reply with FTS and recursive-webhook suppression; expired lease recovery, fencing, heartbeat renewal, bounded retries and dead state. |
| Backup/restore | Actual SQLite/storage round trip with integrity check; archive traversal/link rejection. Stop writers for consistency with file lifecycle. |

Verification is limited to the exercised workflows, not a claim of exhaustive Rails
parity. Public-site OpenGraph behavior and live browser-vendor push delivery remain
unverified; native transports reject private destinations and pin resolved addresses.
Malformed/legacy rich text outside the independent corpus can differ. Unsupported
older SQLite schemas require migration by the original application before upgrade.

The frozen production runtime is `124694f` (Node 24.21.0 / Express 5.2.1). All 52
native methods pass without seed skips. Independent checks passed 26 browser
assertions without JavaScript errors, 18 HTTP/session checks, 11 request boundaries,
6 crafted room-namespace checks, 4 real multi-tab presence checks and 3 socket
privacy checks. Runtime source and compiled asset hashes match the production image.

HTTP reads use two 4-second samples; writes use two 15-second samples, alternating
implementation order. Express posting varied from 206 to 305 requests/second, with
higher tail latency than Rails; the table reports the median, not a capacity limit.
The unchanged common load generator and original seed hashes are recorded in ignored
scratch evidence. Benchmark orchestration is Ruby, and server processes share four
hardware threads; Express uses three HTTP workers and its primary job/fanout process.

The in-progress OxCaml port has a separate production-image verification record. Its
authenticated `POST /unfurl_link` was exercised against `https://ogp.me/` in the
production image and returned the expected title, canonical URL, image, and description;
its image MIME check and URL validation were part of that request. This is a focused
live-site smoke, not broad OpenGraph compatibility coverage. Fetches reject non-public
resolved addresses, pin the selected address for each curl request, follow at most ten
HTTP(S) requests, cap bodies at 5 MiB, and use a 15-second shared fetch deadline. DNS
rebinding, varied public sites, and full parity with Rails' unfurling edge cases remain
unverified. The OxCaml route preflight separately checks CSRF rejection, private-loopback
denial, and missing-URL handling.
